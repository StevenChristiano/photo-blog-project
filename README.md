# photo-blog-project
Hi Hello Everyone! Thanks for coming and review my Photo Blog project

This project is using:
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- 
I'm still learning, and this project is actually just me sharpening my skill in using HTML and CSS

also start learning how to apply bootstrap inside it

Photo Blog Project is a Website to collect and show your photo. The first page is showing 
picture that you want to display. Then when you click it, It will direct you to a page where
you can get a brief information about the picture you just clicked on. That's it. 

Once Again, Thank You for coming. Hope you can get inspiration from my project or intrigued to see 
my other project.
